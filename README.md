## Overview

This repository implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline combining:
- **LangChain** for orchestrating LLM workflows.
- **ChromaDB** as a fast and efficient vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
- **Ollama** for generating responses using fine-tuned LLMs.

The pipeline is designed for tasks such as question answering, summarization, and other NLP applications where leveraging external knowledge sources is crucial.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily adapt and extend the pipeline for various use cases.
- **Embeddings Storage**: Store and retrieve embeddings using ChromaDB.
- **Contextual Generations**: Retrieve relevant context and pass it to LLMs using LangChain.
- **Seamless Integration**: Pre-integrated with Ollama for generating fine-tuned outputs.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage guide included.
